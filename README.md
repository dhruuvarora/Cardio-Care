HEART DISEASE ANALYSIS

About Heart Disease

Heart disease, a term encompassing various conditions that impact the heart, includes diseases related to blood vessels like coronary artery disease. According to World Health Organization statistics, every year witnesses 17.9 million deaths attributed to heart disease. The medical study asserts: human lifestyle serves as the primary catalyst for this cardiac issue. However, numerous key factors - distinct predictors - exist; they offer a warning--a potential indicator of elevated risk or not--towards contracting heart disease.

We will utilize the dataset to develop a pertinent machine learning technique: one that classifies heart disease with higher accuracy. This approach proves immensely beneficial not only to health organizations, but also patients.

Packages and dataset description

About the Data set

The dataset presents heart disease-related information: it comprises 13 columns, with the class variable--impacted by the remaining 12--serving as our target. Our objective here is to classify this target variable into 'disease' or 'non-disease' using a variety of machine learning algorithms; ultimately, we aim to determine which specific algorithm best suits this particular dataset.

CHOL (serum cholestoral in mg/dl)

FBS (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

RESTECH (resting electrocardiographic results)

THALACH (maximum heart rate achieved)

EXANG (exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no))

OLDPEAK (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest)

SLOPE (the slope of the peak exercise ST segment)

CA (number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy)
